          Hi, my names Gavin Potter. Some of my hobbies include, demoing code,
          reading about history, and going for walks. Where am I at with code?
          Well, I first started coding when I had just turned 20. I remember
          sitting in my bed in my moms old victorian era house in one of the
          smaller more cozy bedrooms of my house and coding away on code
          academy. I started doing html and css. I remember vividly I was
          studying civil technology at UNH when all of a sudden my uncle Dean
          Potter died in a wingsuiting accident. One more semester at UNH and I
          would be on my way to newer and better things. I saw civil technology
          as a deadend. One of five children the second youngest of my four
          siblings I rivaled my oldest brother James. He studied at UNH and got
          his degree in chemical engineering. I remember he asked my dad over a
          famous telephone call they both had, what degree will get me the
          highest paying job, my dad said chemical engineering. While James or
          Jimmy as we call him is fun to pace, so are my other two brothers
          Edward and John or Teddy and Jack. They both study geology. Teddy
          works for a surveying cad company and he employs my youngest brother
          Jack through honorable mention to his superiors. They're equally fun
          to pace as jimmy. I find it hard meeting people with my work ethic,
          and that is being a philomath. Philomath - is a lover of learning and
          studying. as defined by wikipedia. I love studying and to learn as
          well. I thought to myself where is there an occupation I can just keep
          learning. Computer science, code in particular was it. I hope to
          expand my knowledge of code far past javascript. I'm excited about
          angular, react, and vue. I've taken an online class on angular and
          built my very own angular app. I'm never satisfied. As lucrative as
          coding is, I see it as the future. And I'm excited to be apart of
          that. I'm looking for people that will help me stay focused on data
          and sets of data. I'm excited about minipulating data and where that
          is going to take me on the journey of life. I have colossal
          aspirations. I want my work to reach the stars. Theres one last
          sibling. Brynn, my sister, the second oldest, her husband AJ is a
          software engineer as well he specializes in vue.js. I hope to reach
          his level of expertise someday. Anyways, what was I saying...? Oh yeah
          i was 20 coding in my bedroom, i did three semesters at UNH Thompson
          school and then decided not to go any further. I had to code. Civil
          technology was too deadend. Architectural technology to be exact. I
          took two years and just coded, did some math on khan academy and some
          other brainy stuff; I fell in love with art and studied art infact. I
          originally was taking time off coding but I found myself obsessed with
          art and studying paintings from ancient egpytian papyrus to vincent
          van gogh, but eventually my awe settled and there was only so much art
          you could study. I did some construction as well to see if I would
          like it. I didnt mind it but it wasnt me. So went back to UNH finished
          my degree in civil technology why not finish it get the degree.
          Graduated UNH with a degree i saw as useless. But I was high off the
          art I studied and i knew God had beautiful plans for me. And so I
          found myself working at Home Depot while getting back up on my feet
          with coding. I took an online course called The Complete JavaScript
          Course 2020: Build Real Projects taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. I
          learned all the basics along with some ES6+, OOP, AJAX. Next i took a
          coarse on angular. I loved the coarse on angular much more than the
          coarse on just vanilla javascript. I felt like i was learning a great
          deal. I built the project with the instructor the class was called
          Angular - The Complete Guide (2020 edition) taught by Maximilian
          Schwarzmuller. These two coarses tug boated me into the UNH bootcamp
          which i'm thoroughly enjoying. Before i knew about github.io i had my
          own domain name which i hosted through godaddy.
